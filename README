NAME
	filesrv - single-file web server

SYNOPSIS
	filesrv [-l] [-p port] file

DESCRIPTION
	filesrv is a single-file web server. It handles TCP connections serially
	to avoid fork exhaustion during high traffic. The -p option specifies
	the listening port. The default is to listen on port 8080.

	The -l option specifies that the input file requires lazy reading. This
	is usually the case with large files which cannot be comfortably
	pre-loaded. The default behavior is to memory-map the entire input file.

	filesrv will try to persist connection errors, and will continue to
	accept connections after it encounters any errors. It does not read any
	portion of the request data.

	When sent SIGINT, filesrv will clean itself up and exit gracefully.

	If given port 0, filesrv will print the port number assigned by the
	kernel.

	If filesrv is run with root privileges, it will chroot to the current
	working directory after opening the input file.
