NAME
	filesrv - filesystem web server

SYNOPSIS
	filesrv [-d] [-p port] [-t timeout] [-u user] dir

DESCRIPTION
	filesrv is a filesystem web server. It responds with directory listings
	or file contents based on the request path. The -d option daemonizes the
	process. The -p option specifies the listening port, otherwise 8080 by
	default. -t option specifies the read and write timeout, otherwise 3
	seconds by default.

	The -u option causes filesrv to drop privileges to the specified user.
	This is only available when filesrv is run as root. It is useful when
	listening on a privileged lower port without needing persistent root
	access.
